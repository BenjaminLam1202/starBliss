# starBliss  <a href='https://github.com/benyamindsmith/starBliss'><img src='https://github.com/benyamindsmith/starBliss/blob/main/starBliss.png' align="right" height="300" /></a>

Initially inspired by an issue posted on the [`mapBliss`](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/mapBliss/issues/10) package. The goal of this package is to create print quality starmap art similar to what is available online on many websites like [Maps For Moments](https://mapsformoments.co.uk) and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/star_map) within the R console.

As is the case with all projects. This one is a work in progress. So this repository will change over time!

<h3>Why this isn't included in `mapBliss`</h3>
</summary>

The `mapBliss` package utlizes leafleat and creates dynamic maps which can be screenshot to make custom maps. For visualization `starBliss` uses `ggplot2` creates static visuals which can be saved by using the `ggsave`. Since the approaches to making visuals were so different, I thought it was best make keep `mapBliss` and `starBliss` seperate in their construction.
